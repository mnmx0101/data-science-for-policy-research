# Module: Geospatial Analysis with GeoPandas

### Motivation
Geospatial data adds a **location dimension** to analysis. Understanding where events happen is just as important as knowing what happened. With libraries like **GeoPandas**, we can handle geospatial datasets, visualize maps, and perform spatial operations such as intersections, joins, and clustering.

### Objective
In this module, you will:
- Learn how to work with geospatial data in Python using **GeoPandas**.
- Explore shapefiles and GeoJSON datasets.
- Visualize maps with thematic coloring (choropleths).
- Perform simple **spatial analytics** (e.g., distance, overlays, joins).

### Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Load and explore shapefiles and geospatial datasets.
- Plot maps and create choropleth visualizations.
- Conduct spatial joins and overlays.
- Use geospatial analysis to support decision-making.
