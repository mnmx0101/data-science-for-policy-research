# Python Fundamentals: Variables, Control Flow, Functions, and Reusable Code  

## Motivation  
Imagine trying to cook without being able to store ingredients in a bowl, follow steps in a recipe, or reuse your favorite sauce. That would be chaotic, right?  
Well, coding without **variables, control flow, and functions** feels the same way!  

These building blocks are what make Python powerful, structured, and fun. Once you master them, you can start solving real-world problems with clean, reusable code.

## Objectives  
By the end of this module, you will:  
- Understand **variables** and how to store information in Python.  
- Use **control flow** (if/else, loops) to make decisions and repeat tasks.  
- Write your own **functions** to organize and reuse code.  
- Learn how to build **modular and reusable code** like a pro.  

---

## Expected Outcomes  
After completing this module, you will be able to:  
- Write simple Python scripts that use variables effectively.  
- Automate repetitive tasks using loops.  
- Make your code smart by handling conditions with `if/else`.  
- Break down problems into **functions** so you don’t repeat yourself (DRY principle).  
- Develop a reusable code style that makes collaboration easier.
