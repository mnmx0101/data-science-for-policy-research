# Data Cleaning & EDA: handling missing values, outliers, exploratory analysis

## Motivation
Real-world data is often messy â€” some values are missing, others are extreme (outliers), and many patterns are hidden until we explore them.  
Without **cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, we risk drawing wrong conclusions. Cleaning ensures **data quality**, while EDA helps us **understand patterns, relationships, and surprises** before modeling.  

## Objective
By the end of this module, you will:
- Learn strategies for **detecting and handling missing values**.  
- Understand how to **identify and treat outliers**.  
- Explore **data distributions, correlations, and summary statistics** through EDA.  
- Gain confidence in preparing a dataset for deeper analysis or machine learning.  

## Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Detect, visualize, and treat **missing values** appropriately (drop, fill, impute).  
- Identify and handle **outliers** using statistical or visual methods.  
- Perform **basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with summary statistics and plots.  
- Generate insights that help guide **further analysis or modeling**.
