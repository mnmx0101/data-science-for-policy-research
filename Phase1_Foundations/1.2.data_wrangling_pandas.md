# Data Wrangling & Analysis: pandas for structuring and transforming raw data

## Motivation
Raw data is rarely ready for analysis — it often comes messy, incomplete, or in inconvenient formats.  
Being able to clean, reshape, and transform data is one of the most important skills in data science.  
That’s where **pandas** (Python Data Analysis Library) comes in! With pandas, you can quickly turn messy spreadsheets or CSVs into well-structured datasets that are ready for insights.

## Objective
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the basics of **pandas DataFrames and Series**.
- Learn how to **load, inspect, and clean raw data**.
- Practice **transformations** such as filtering, grouping, and aggregating.
- Explore ways to **reshape data** using pivot tables, merges, and concatenation.

## Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Confidently **import and explore datasets** with pandas.
- Perform common **data wrangling tasks**: handling missing values, renaming columns, filtering rows, etc.
- **Reshape and summarize** data for deeper analysis.
- Apply transformations that prepare raw data for visualization or machine learning.
