# Module: Data Acquisition (APIs & Web Scraping)

### Motivation
Data is everywhere, but not always ready in a neat CSV. Analysts and scientists often acquire data directly from **APIs** (structured, machine-friendly sources) or through **web scraping** when no API is available.

### Objective
In this module, you will:
- Learn how to fetch data from a public **API** using Python.
- Understand the basics of **web scraping** with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
- Get hands-on experience in cleaning raw data into usable formats.

### Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Connect to APIs and retrieve structured data.
- Scrape useful information from websites.
- Build your own datasets when none are readily available.
