# Module: Causal Inference for Policy Evaluation

---

## 1. Motivation
Data analysis often tells us **what is correlated**, but policy makers need to know:  
**“Did this policy cause the change?”**  

Example:  
- Did raising the minimum wage reduce employment?  
- Did a new healthcare program improve health outcomes?  

To answer such questions, we need **causal inference**.  

---

## 2. The Gold Standard: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

### Idea
- Randomly assign units (people, firms, regions) to treatment vs control.  
- Randomization ensures treatment and control are statistically identical **on average**.  
- Differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment.  

\[
ATE = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]
\]

where:  
- \( Y(1) \) = outcome if treated  
- \( Y(0) \) = outcome if not treated  
- \( ATE \) = Average Treatment Effect  

---

## 3. The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference
We never observe both \( Y(1) \) and \( Y(0) \) for the same unit.  
We see one outcome, not the counterfactual.  

Thus, we need methods to **approximate the counterfactual**.  

Key estimand:  
- **ATT (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated)**  
\[
ATT = E[Y(1) - Y(0) \mid D=1]
\]
where \( D=1 \) indicates treated units.  

---

## 4. Quasi-Experimental Methods

### 4.1 Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
Used when we have **before and after data** for both treated and untreated groups.

\[
DiD = ( \bar{Y}_{T,post} - \bar{Y}_{T,pre} ) - ( \bar{Y}_{C,post} - \bar{Y}_{C,pre} )
\]

Assumption: **parallel trends** (in absence of treatment, treated and control would have evolved similarly).  

Application:  
- Evaluating policy rollouts (e.g., state implements new law, compare with other states).  

---

### 4.2 Matching (Propensity Score Matching)
Idea: Create a **control group that looks like the treated group**.  
Steps:  
1. Estimate propensity score = probability of treatment given covariates.  
\[
p(X) = P(D=1 \mid X)
\]  
2. Match treated units with control units with similar \( p(X) \).  
3. Compare outcomes.  

Application:  
- Observational studies (e.g., comparing patients who did vs didn’t receive a treatment).  

---

## 5. Policy Evaluation Contexts
- **DiD** → natural experiments with clear before/after and treatment/control.  
- **Matching** → observational studies where we want to mimic randomization.  
- **Other methods**: Regression Discontinuity, Instrumental Variables.  

---

## 6. Objectives
- Understand RCT as the causal inference benchmark.  
- Define ATE and ATT.  
- Apply DiD and Matching for policy evaluation.  

---

## 7. Expected Outcomes
You will be able to:
- Explain causal inference concepts clearly.  
- Estimate ATT using matching and DiD.  
- Discuss assumptions and limitations of each method.  
- Apply methods to real policy questions.
