# Module: Large Language Models (LLMs) & Responsible AI

---

## 1. Motivation
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, BERT, and T5 enable powerful applications:
- Summarizing long documents.
- Thematic analysis of text corpora.
- Question answering and information retrieval.
- Conversational chatbots.

But with great power comes great responsibility.  
LLMs raise concerns about:
- **Transparency** (how do they work?).
- **Accountability** (who is responsible for errors or harms?).
- **Fairness & Bias** (do they disadvantage certain groups?).
- **Hallucination** (when models produce fluent but false answers).  

Understanding both **technical capabilities** and **ethical challenges** is critical for deploying LLMs in sensitive domains (e.g., healthcare, law, finance).

## 2. The Big Picture: LLMs

### Transformer Architecture
- Key innovation: **self-attention**.
\[
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

- Stacked layers → deep contextual understanding.  
- Pre-training on massive corpora + fine-tuning for tasks.

## 3. Responsible AI Framework

### 3.1 Transparency
- Open documentation (model cards, datasheets).  
- Clear reporting of training data & limitations.  

### 3.2 Accountability
- Define responsibility for model outputs.  
- Logging & audit trails.  

### 3.3 Fairness
- Bias in training data → biased outputs.  
- Evaluate across demographic subgroups.  

### 3.4 Hallucination
LLMs sometimes **make up facts** confidently.  
Causes:  
- Training objective (next-token prediction, not truth).  
- Limited grounding in external knowledge.  

Mitigation:  
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
- Fact-checking pipelines.  
- User interface disclaimers.

## 4. Objectives
- Learn advanced LLM applications (summarization, themes, Q&A, chatbots).  
- Understand Responsible AI principles: transparency, fairness, accountability.  
- Analyze hallucination risks and mitigation strategies.

## 5. Expected Outcomes
You will be able to:
- Use Hugging Face pipelines for summarization, thematic classification, Q&A, and chatbot tasks.  
- Identify risks of bias and hallucination.  
- Explain Responsible AI practices in real-world deployment.
