# Module: Statistical Analysis (Regression & Modeling)

### Motivation
Exploratory plots describe data, but **statistical analysis** explains *relationships*. Regression helps us understand how variables influence each other and allows us to make predictions. It is a foundation for data-driven decision-making.

### Objective
In this module, you will:
- Explore regression models using `statsmodels`.
- Understand model fitting, interpretation, and diagnostics.
- Evaluate assumptions and measure model performance.

### Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Fit linear regression models.
- Interpret coefficients and p-values.
- Check residuals and assumptions for model validity.
- Extend models with multiple predictors.
