# Module: Data Visualization (Static & Interactive)

### Motivation
Data alone often fails to convey a clear message. Visualization allows us to transform raw numbers into meaningful stories. By combining **static plots** (matplotlib, seaborn) with **interactive visualizations** (plotly), we can make our findings both understandable and engaging.

### Objective
In this module, you will:
- Learn to build **static plots** with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Create **interactive visualizations** with `plotly`.
- Understand how to choose the right visualization for the right task.

### Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Plot and customize static charts (line, bar, scatter, histograms).
- Enhance plots with seabornâ€™s statistical visualizations.
- Build interactive dashboards and plots using plotly.
- Confidently use visualization to support analysis and storytelling.
