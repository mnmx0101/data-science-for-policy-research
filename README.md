# Data Science: Tools & Projects

This repository demonstrates practical applications of data science through tutorials, reusable code, and full projects. It is structured to help bridge the gap between **methods** and **real-world policy analysis**.

- **/tutorials** – step-by-step notebooks on foundations and applied methods  
- **/projects** – complete end-to-end analyses of real problems  
- **/resources** – curated readings and references

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations
- Data wrangling with **pandas**  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Data acquisition via APIs and scraping  
- Introductory statistics with **statsmodels**

### Phase 2: Applied Methods
- Machine learning with **scikit-learn**  
- Explainability and fairness with **SHAP** and **fairlearn**  
- Natural Language Processing with **spaCy** and Hugging Face  
- Geospatial analysis with **geopandas**  
- Causal inference (Difference-in-Differences, Matching)

### Phase 3: Projects
- Full end-to-end workflows  
- Dashboards with **Streamlit**  
- Policy briefs and communication of results

## Example Project

**Evaluating Humanitarian Aid with NLP and Causal Inference**  
- Built a geo-coded dataset from UN reports using NLP  
- Applied Staggered Difference-in-Differences to estimate aid allocation impact  
- Found aid increases after emergency declarations but remains **insufficient per capita**, pointing to gaps in targeting and accountability

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and set up a Python environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
````

Use **Conda** or **venv** to manage dependencies.
