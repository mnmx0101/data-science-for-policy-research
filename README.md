## About This Repository

This repository is a practical guide to the data science workflow, offering reusable code and project examples. It is structured in three phases, each designed to build upon the last:

### Phase 1: Foundations
Covers the essential skills for any data-centric role, focusing on how to manipulate, explore, and visualize data to transform it from raw format into insight.

### Phase 2: Applied Methods
Introduces advanced techniques that allow for prediction, pattern discovery, and causal analysis. Focus is on applying tools such as machine learning and NLP to answer more complex questions.

### Phase 3: Project Development
Synthesizes all learned skills into end-to-end projects and data-driven tools, emphasizing the translation of findings into actionable outcomes.

The goal is to provide a hands-on toolkit that bridges the gap between data science methods and real-world questions.
