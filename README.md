Data Science for Public Policy: Tools & Projects
Welcome to this repository of resources and projects demonstrating the application of data science in the public policy domain. This collection is designed to provide practical examples and reusable code for analyzing policy challenges with modern data tools.

About This Repository
This repository serves as a practical guide to the data science workflow in a policy context. It is structured into two main phases:

Phase 1 (Foundations): Focuses on the foundational skills required for any data analysis project, including data wrangling, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.

Phase 2 (Applied Methods): Transitions to advanced techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), geospatial analysis, causal inference, and explainable AI (XAI).

The goal is to provide a hands-on toolkit that bridges the gap between data science methods and real-world policy questions.

Repository Organization
All materials are organized into two main directories: resources and projects.

How to Get Started
To use these resources, you should clone this repository to your local machine. This will create a local copy of all the notebooks and datasets.

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git)

It is highly recommended to set up a dedicated Python environment to manage all necessary libraries. An environment.yml file may be provided for use with Conda.

Toolkit & Methods Covered
Phase 1: Foundational Tools
Python Fundamentals: Variables, Control Flow, and Functions.

Data Wrangling and Analysis: Mastery of the pandas library for data manipulation.

Data Cleaning and EDA: Techniques for handling missing data, outliers, and performing exploratory data analysis.

Data Visualization: Creating static (matplotlib, seaborn) and interactive (plotly) plots for policy communication.

Data Acquisition: Fetching data from APIs and performing web scraping with BeautifulSoup.

Statistical Analysis: Introduction to statistical modeling with statsmodels.

Phase 2: Applied Methods & Advanced Topics
Machine Learning: Supervised and unsupervised learning with scikit-learn for prediction and segmentation.

Model Evaluation, Fairness, and Explainable AI (XAI): Assessing model performance, auditing for bias (fairlearn), and interpreting model decisions (SHAP, LIME).

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text analysis using spaCy and modern transformer models with the Hugging Face ecosystem.

Geospatial Analysis: Creating policy maps and performing spatial analysis with geopandas.

Causal Inference: Estimating policy impact using methods like Difference-in-Differences and Matching.

Large Language Models (LLMs): Leveraging LLMs for policy text summarization, thematic analysis, and data extraction.

Responsible AI: Ethical considerations and best practices for deploying AI systems in the public sector.

About the Author
This repository is maintained by Chungmann Kim, an applied development economist specializing in food security and nutrition. His research focuses on using causal inference and big data analytics to investigate the impacts of economic and environmental conditions on human welfare.

In addition to his academic work, he serves as a Data Scientist and Modeling Specialist at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and an Impact Assessment Specialist at the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), where he works to provide policymaking groups with actionable, data-driven insights to address global food security challenges.
