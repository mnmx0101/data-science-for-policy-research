# Data Science: Tools & Projects

Welcome to this repository of resources and projects demonstrating the application of data science.  
This collection is designed to provide **practical examples** and **reusable code** for analyzing complex problems with modern data tools.

## About This Repository

This repository is a practical guide to the **data science workflow**, providing reusable code and project examples.  
It is structured in three phases, each designed to build upon the last:

- **Phase 1: Foundations**  
  Covers the essential skills for any data-centric role, focusing on how to manipulate, explore, and visualize data to transform it from raw format into meaningful insight.

- **Phase 2: Applied Methods**  
  Introduces advanced techniques that allow for prediction, pattern discovery, and causal analysis. The focus is on applying machine learning, NLP, and other advanced tools to answer complex questions.

- **Phase 3: Project Development**  
  Synthesizes all skills into the creation of end-to-end projects and data-driven tools, emphasizing translation of findings into actionable outcomes.

The goal is to provide a **hands-on toolkit** that bridges the gap between **methods** and **real-world policy questions**.

## Toolkit & Methods Covered

### Phase 1: Foundational Tools
- **Python Fundamentals**: variables, control flow, functions, reusable code  
- **Data Wrangling & Analysis**: pandas for structuring and transforming raw data  
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: handling missing values, outliers, exploratory analysis  
- **Data Visualization**: static plots (matplotlib, seaborn) and interactive (plotly)  
- **Data Acquisition**: APIs and web scraping with BeautifulSoup  
- **Statistical Analysis**: regression and modeling with statsmodels  

### Phase 2: Applied Methods & Advanced Topics
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- **Model Evaluation, Fairness & Explainable AI**: accuracy, bias auditing (fairlearn), interpretability (SHAP, feature importance)  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: spaCy and Hugging Face transformers for text extraction, themes, and sentiment  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: geopandas for mapping and spatial analytics  
- **Causal Inference**: methods like Difference-in-Differences and Matching for policy evaluation  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: advanced summarization, thematic analysis, document processing  
- **Responsible AI**: transparency, accountability, and fairness in sensitive domains  

### Phase 3: Applied Policy Projects & Tool Development
- **End-to-End Project Workflow**: from scoping a question to communicating results  
- **Dashboarding & Tool Development**: real-time monitoring tools with Streamlit/Dash  
- **Policy Brief Communication**: translating results into concise, non-technical outputs

## Guideline for Project Development

1. **Scope the Question**  
   Start with a specific, measurable, and policy-relevant question.  
   Example: *"What is the causal impact of a conditional cash transfer program on school attendance rates in District A?"*

2. **Acquire and Prepare Data**  
   Gather, clean, and integrate diverse sources (survey data, remote sensing, admin records).  
   Real-world data is messy â€” persistence and creativity are key.

3. **Select Methods**  
   Match tools to questions: machine learning for prediction, causal inference for impact evaluation, geospatial analysis for resource allocation.

4. **Analyze and Interpret**  
   Go beyond numbers. Explain not only what results show but why they matter in context.

5. **Communicate for Impact**  
   Present findings clearly to decision-makers via briefs, dashboards, or reports.  
   Use visuals and concise writing to ensure results are actionable.

## Project: Evaluating Aid Responsiveness with NLP and Causal Inference ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡«

**Policy Question:** Do institutional crisis alerts, like the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), trigger a timely and sufficient humanitarian aid response in Afghanistan?

**Challenge:** Official aid data often lacks the **subnational detail** needed to track financial flows to specific crisis-affected regions, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of crisis response systems.

**Solution:**
* Used **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and geospatial algorithms to construct a novel, **provincial-level dataset** of aid flows from the UN's Financial Tracking Service. ðŸ’»
* Applied a **Staggered Difference-in-Differences** model to causally estimate the impact of a severe food security emergency on aid allocation.

**Key Findings:**
* A crisis alert triggers a **rapid and statistically significant** increase in aid.
* However, this response is **transitory**, diminishing quickly after the initial months.
* The aid is also **insufficient**, falling substantially short of the estimated need (the "need gap").
* Responsiveness **varies significantly** across different donors and funding types.

**Impact:**
This study provides the **first granular, causal evidence** on subnational aid responsiveness, highlighting the critical gap between signaling an emergency and sufficiently addressing it. The findings offer a data-driven foundation for improving aid allocation policies and enhancing accountability in humanitarian finance.
